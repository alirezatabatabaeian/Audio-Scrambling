### ***Introduction:***

***Audio scrambling is a technique used to make recorded audio difficult or impossible to understand by applying various forms of distortion to the sound. This can be done through techniques such as phase shifting, frequency shifting, or time compression/expansion. Audio scrambling is often used for security or privacy reasons, such as in telecommunications or in the creation of surveillance recordings that need to be kept confidential.***

### ***Implementation:***

***In this project, an audio is scrambled using a low frequency modulation and a low frequency filter to be unrecognizable. Furthermore, our hashing is reversible so weâ€™ve implemented the reconstruction section which can be chosen from the above tab in the below figure:***
